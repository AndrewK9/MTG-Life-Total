#Multiplayer MTG

##The Magic: The Gathering life counter applicaiton where each user tracks their own life via their android device.

###Description
The goal of Multiplayer MTG was to create an android application where each user can manage their own life and infect totals while being able to check the other players health. I created an app where the users can connect to a server, input their names and initials, and then play with their friends. Instead of forcing one player to manage everyones life totals, each player can manage their own.

###The Server
You can download the server [here](http://www.gamesbykyle.com/MTGAPP.zip). In order to run the server.js file you will need to install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

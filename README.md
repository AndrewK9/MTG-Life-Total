## Introduction
The goal of Multiplayer MTG was to create an android application where each user can manage their own life and infect totals while being able to check the other players health. I created an app where the users can connect to a server, input their names and initials, and then play with their friends. Instead of forcing one player to manage everyones life totals, each player can manage their own.

## Install
This project uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and no other dependencies.

You can download the client for Android [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.MultiMTG&hl=en).

## Usage
### Server
To launch the server just run the server.js file with nodejs. Once its started choose your desired port and starting life total.

### Players
Players just need to connect to the IPv4 address of the server along with the correct port number. Once everyone is in the lobby the game can begin. All players will manage their own life and infect totals using their devices.

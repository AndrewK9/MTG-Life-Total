## Introduction
The goal of Multiplayer Magic was to create an android application where each user can manage their own life and infect totals while being able to check the other players stats. I created an app where the users can connect to a server, input their names and join or host a match. People can play with their friends and focus on having fun instead of forcing one player to manage everyones stats.

## Install
This project uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and no non-standard dependencies.

You can download the client for Android [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.MultiMTG&hl=en).

## Usage
### Server
To launch the server just run the server.js file with nodejs. You could also connect to the US based server if you can't host your own.

### Players
Players can join a match by typing in the custom room code.
